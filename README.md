# Jupyter_Lab_Shortcut
Jupyer_lab anaconda shortcut scripts
This Repo is an example of how you could easily use anaconda and launch jupyterlab from a shortcut without needing to launch anaconda and activate the environemnts you want.

To use this, copy the `activate_julab` file to the `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\anaconda3\Scripts\` path.
The shortcut assumes a `GIT_REPOS` folder on the Desktop, but if this is not where your Git Repositories are stored you can change the .bat files to suit your location or you can give it the path in the terminal prompts.
